# Title

# Abstract
Climate change is one of today's biggest challenge. Agriculture plays an important role, notably meat production. Meat can have a high environmental impact and be expensive in terms of resources to produce: it takes 15'415 liters of water for a single kilogram of beef.
In order to reduce their environmental footprint, people alter their behavior, such as reducing their meat consumption. But there are other reasons also, such as ethical (animal cruelty in factories). Our aim is to first explore the general trend in meat consumption: is it going down ?  We then want to analyze what are the main drivers in change in meat consumption: is it for ethical, environmental, or mostly economical  reasons ? Are campaigns effective ? Our hope is that having a better understanding of reasons for change in meat consumption can lead to better policy to promote a reduction.


# Research questions
- What are the reasons for the variations of meat consumption? Are they ethical (animals cruelty), ecological or economical?
- Does a country situation have an impact on meat consumption?
- Does some campaigns have an impact on meat consumption?
